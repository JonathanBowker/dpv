    dct:description "Digital resources, e.g., resources stored in Solid pods, might contain multiple types of personal data categories, including sensitive personal data categories. For instance, in the Solid ecossystem, tagging the resources, or their metadata, with the personal data categories they contain will assist in the matching of personal data categories and the access control policies expressed for those particular categories of data." ;

    dct:description "There are a vast number of concepts associated with data processing, with differences and variations across jurisdictions, domains, and sectors. A common dictionary of concepts with information on how they relate to other concepts across such differences would be an invaluable resource on its own. This could be a simple list, a dictionary, or a thesauri." ;

ucr:U3 a ucr:UseCase ;
    dct:description "The concepts associated with a particular task can be considered the vocabulary necessary for representing information for that particular task. For example choosing the appropriate legal basis requires the concept associated with legal basis as well as the specific legal bases that can be utilised. In order to assist in providing the appropriate contextual vocabulary, the concepts should be encoded in a form that can be automatically queried or retrieved depending on the context." ;
