This scope could be extended by later versions to other data and privacy protection regulations. The vocabulary provides terms to describe which personal data Categories are undergoing a specified kind of processing by a specific data controller and/or transferred to some recipient for a particular purpose , based on a specific legal ground (e.g. consent, or other legal grounds such as legitimate interest, etc.), with specified technical and organisational measures and restrictions (e.g. storage locations and storage durations) in place.
